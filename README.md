Regression <br/>

**What is Logistic Regression** <br/>
A basic machine learning approach that is frequently used for binary classification tasks is called logistic regression. Though its name suggests otherwise, it uses the sigmoid function to simulate the likelihood of an instance falling into a specific class, producing values between 0 and 1. Logistic regression, with its emphasis on interpretability, simplicity, and efficient computation, is widely applied in a variety of fields, such as marketing, finance, and healthcare, and it offers insightful forecasts and useful information for decision-making. <br/>
<br/>
A statistical model for binary classification is called logistic regression. Using the sigmoid function, it forecasts the likelihood that an instance will belong to a particular class, guaranteeing results between 0 and 1. To minimize the log loss, the model computes a linear combination of input characteristics, transforms it using the sigmoid, and then optimizes its coefficients using methods like gradient descent. These coefficients establish the decision boundary that divides the classes. Because of its ease of use, interpretability, and versatility across multiple domains, Logistic Regression is widely used in machine learning for problems that involve binary outcomes. Overfitting can be avoided by implementing regularization. <br/>

**How the Logistic Regression Algorithm Works** <br/>
Logistic Regression models the likelihood that an instance will belong to a particular class. It uses a linear equation to combine the input information and the sigmoid function to restrict predictions between 0 and 1. Gradient descent and other techniques are used to optimize the modelâ€™s coefficients to minimize the log loss. These coefficients produce the resulting decision boundary, which divides instances into two classes. When it comes to binary classification, logistic regression is the best choice because it is easy to understand, straightforward, and useful in a variety of settings. Generalization can be improved by using regularization. <br/>
